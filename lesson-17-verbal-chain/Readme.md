# Verbal Chain
The finite verbal chain incorporate pronominal references to the subject,
to the object and to the verb's other modifiers. These references
agree with the modifier in person, number and gender.

A finite verbal chain is also marked by one of several **conjugation prefixes.**

## Finite-marker prefix /i3/ 𒉌, /ib2/ 𒌈, /im/ 𒉎, /in/ 𒅔

The finite-marker prefix is spelled /i3/ 𒉌 when it occurs without
any other prefixes. If other prefixes are present, it is spelled
 𒌈 (ib2), 𒉎 (im) or 𒅔 (in). There exist plene writings such
as 𒉌𒅔 (i3-in-) , and 𒉌𒌈 (i3-ib2-).


### hamtu sg 𒁺 • (du) -- to walk; hamtu pl. 𒁻 (re₇); participle 𒁲 (di)
### marû sg 𒁺 • (du) -- to walk, to go; marû pl. 𒁻 (su₈, sub₂); imperative 𒂷 (g̃e₂₆)

### 𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 ib2-ši-du-un
**I am going to it.**
#### 𒂠 • (še₃ /še/ or /š/) -- to, towards
#### 𒅆 • (ši) -- to it

### 𒂍𒂠𒉌𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 i3-du-un
**I am going to the house.**

### 𒂍𒂠𒌈𒌈𒅆𒁺𒌦 e2-še3 ib2-ši-du-un
**I am going to it towards the house.**
#### 𒅆 (ši, to it) agrees with 𒂍𒂠 (e2-še3, to the house)

### 𒅔𒅆𒁺 in ši du
**He walks to her.**

### 𒉌𒅔𒅘 i3 in naĝ
**He drinks it.** *Instance of plene writing.*
#### 𒅘 (naĝ) -- to drink

### 𒌈𒆪 ib2 dab5
**They seized it.**
#### 𒆪 (dab5) -- to seize

### 𒉌𒌈𒅅 i3 ib2 g̃al₂
**They are present.** *Another instance of plene writing.*
#### 𒅅 • (g̃al₂ /g̃al/) to exist, be there, be present

## Coordinator prefix  /nga/
The rare prefix -/nga/- means 'also' and occupies the next position in the Sumerian verbal template.
This prefix is often written without the initial /n/. It is usually placed between the conjugation
prefix /i3-/ and the pronominal prefix, but it precedes the conjugation prefix /mu-/, as the
two examples below show.

### 𒅔𒂵𒀭𒍪 in-ga-an-zu
He, too, knows it.

### 𒈾𒂵𒈬𒍪 na-ga-mu-zu
He also understood it.

The scribe may connect two clauses A and B by adding the coordinator prefix /nga/ to
the verb of the second clause. In doing so, it renders
a meaning “A, and also B,” or negated “neither A, nor B.”

### 𒃲𒈬𒍪 𒃲 𒉌𒂵𒁺𒈬 gal mu-zu i3 ga tum2 mu
He knows big (things) and can bring here big (things).
#### 𒂵 (ga) -- also
#### hamtu 𒁺 • (tum2 /de/) to bring
#### 𒍪 • (zu) to know 

### 𒀩𒂊𒅇𒆬𒉡𒍝𒆳𒉡𒂵𒀀𒀭 
**alan.e u3 ku3 nu za gin3 nu ga am3**\
**This statue is neither silver nor precious stone.**
#### 𒀩 • (alan) statue
#### 𒂊 • (e) ergative marker 
#### 𒅇 • (u₃) and; neither... nor
#### 𒉡 • (nu) to be not
#### 𒆬 • (ku₃) metal, silver
#### 𒍝𒆳 • (za gin3) precious stone
#### 𒀀𒀭 • (am₃ /am/) enclitic form of 𒈨 (me, “to be”)

## Ventive prefix 𒈬 (m, mu)
The ventive prefix /m/ (or /mu/) appears before any dimensional infixes.
The ventive expresses proximity to the speaker. Therefore, the
formula 𒈬 𒈾 𒆕 (mu na du3) can be translated as
“he built it here for him/her.” 
#### 𒈬 — ventive prefix
#### 𒈾 — Dimensional Prefix (DP) cross-referencing the dative
#### 𒆕 — verbal root

As we will see below, the ventive prefix can be combined with preceding
prefixes and has the forms shown in the examples that follow.

### 𒉎𒆪 im dab5
**He was seized here.**

### 𒉌𒉎𒁺  i3 im ĝen
He came here.

### 𒉎𒈪𒂃 im mi du8
He was released here.
#### 𒂃 (du8) to release, to set free

### 𒉎𒈠𒁺 im ma ĝen
He went there.
