# Verbs
In lesson 10, we learned that there are two kinds of verbal stems in Sumerian,
which the Akkadians called hamtu and marû. Scholars such as Mamoru Yoshikawa
and Dietz Edzard placed the formation of the marû stem into classes.

## Regular stems
Most Sumerian verbs belong to the regular stem class, where the base
remains unchanged both in the hamtu singular and plural and in the
marû singular and plural, except for an e- that follows the marû
stem. 


### 𒈬 𒊏 𒀊 𒋧𒂊 (mu-r.a-b.šum.e) 
𒊏 (r.a)  to you\
𒋧𒂊 (šum.e) he should give\
𒂊 (e)  he\
𒀊 (a.b) it\
He should give it to you.
