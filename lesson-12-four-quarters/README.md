it indicates the place where the action occurs.

*the king of Ur,*

```;; (cn lugal an ub da limmu2 ba)   𒈗𒀭𒌒𒁕𒇹𒁀```\
*the king of the Four Quarters.*

To say "four quarters," Sumerians use the expression "a four of quarters."
However, they use anticipatory genitive, where the possessor comes first.
In the anticipatory genitive, a possessive must close the whole expression, 𒁀 (ba, "of its").
According to the Wiktionary, the literal translation is 𒀭𒌒𒁕 (an-ub-da, "quarter") +‎ 𒇹 (limmu₂, "four") +‎ 𒁀 (ba, "of its"),
literally "it's four quarters." In this example, the anticipatory genitive becomes an ordinary genitive of 𒈗 (lugal, "king").

Relative clauses, also known as adjective clauses, modify nouns.
According to Kenneth Beare, relative clauses can be reduced
to shorter forms if they qualify the sentence's subject.

In English, the way to form a reduced relative clause is through the past participle:
"Amar-Zuen, proposed in Nippur by Enlil..."

In Sumerian, a reduced relative clause can be formed by deleting the verbal
prefix chain and normalizing the verb with the A-suffix, which transforms the verbal
root into an adjective. Therefore, the entire expression 𒂗𒆤𒆠𒀀 𒀭𒂗𒆤𒇷 𒈬𒅆𒊒𒁕 becomes an adjective.

## Translation
Amar-Zuen, proposed in Nippur by Enlil, patron of the temple of Enlil,
the mighty man, the king of Ur, the king of the four quarters.
