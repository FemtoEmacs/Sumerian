# Creating a new dynamics
To create brush dynamics for Cuneiform, you can simply put the file into the dynamics directory.

Install Wedge-Brush dynamics in the Gimp configuration directory. If you are using Gimp 2.10 in Ubuntu, then the Wedge-Brush dynamics should go to the following directory:

```shell
~/.config/GIMP/2.10/dynamics
```
Of course, if you created your own Wedge-Brush dynamics as instructed in the README.md file, you don't need to worry about installing the Wedge-Brush.gdyn file.
