Special thanks to **Sakamoto Noriaki (na4zagin3)** for creating the Sumerian-Akkadian fonts used in this tutorial. His work allows us to represent the ancient script accurately and beautifully. You can find his fonts at  [https://github.com/na4zagin3/g1951d-fonts](https://github.com/na4zagin3/g1951d-fonts).
