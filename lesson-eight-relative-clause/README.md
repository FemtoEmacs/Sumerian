## Relative clause
In a Sumerian relative clause, there are two elements.
The first element is the head noun, LU2 (𒇽), the person
who built the temple. The second element is a verbal phrase,
which is transformed into an adjective by the suffix A.
There is no need for a relative pronoun, such as who or that.
The verbal phrase follows the noun directly.

Pay attention to an important point: the relative clause ends
in the adjective-forming A-morpheme. After all, relative clauses
are adjectives.

## Translation
Ur-Nammu, the king of Ur, the king of Sumer and Akkad,
the man who built the temple of Enlis.
