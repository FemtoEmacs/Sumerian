# Pronouns
There are two classes of pronouns in Sumerian, the affix
pronouns and the independent pronouns.

## Affix pronouns
The affix pronouns are used with verbs and nouns to indicate
relationships such as possession. Below, you will find the
attested pronouns.

### 𒈬 • (g̃u₁₀ /g̃u/) -- my
### 𒍪 • (zu) thy, your
#### 𒋀𒈬 𒀀𒈾𒍪 𒀀𒊏𒍼 𒅗𒈬 𒈠𒍼
seš-g̃u₁₀ a-na-zu a-ra-gig ka-g̃u₁₀ ma-gig\
My brother, what of you hurts? My mouth hurts.\
𒋀 • (šeš /šeš/) brother, junior worker\
𒀀𒈾 • (a-na /ana/) (interrogative) what?\
𒍼 • (gig) to be sick, to hurt\
𒅗 • (ka /kag/) mouth

#### 𒌉𒈬 𒀀𒈾 𒉡𒍪
dumu-g̃u₁₀ a-na nu-zu?\
What does my son not know?\
𒌉 • (dumu) child, son, daughter\
𒉡 • (nu /nu-/) not, no\
𒍪 • (zu) to know, to know how, be able to

Both pronouns 𒈬 (g̃u₁₀) and 𒍪 (zu)  contract with the vowel
of 1) the genitive case marker /ak/ and 2) the locative
case marker /a/.

#### 𒆦𒈗𒂷 ― kisal lugal-g̃a₂

#### 𒌷𒂷 ― iri-g̃a₂

### (𒀀)𒉌 (a-ni, a-ne₂) -- his, her

####  𒈗 𒀀𒉌
lugal a-ni\
his master

The /a/ of 𒀀𒉌 (a-ne₂ /⁠ane⁠/) contracts with a preceding vowel:

#### 𒊩𒆳𒉌 ― geme₂-ne₂
his girlfriend

The /e/ of 𒀀𒉌 (a-ne₂ /⁠ane⁠/) contracts with the vowel of 1) the
genitive case marker /ak/ and 2) the locative case marker /a/:

#### 𒂍𒀭𒊏𒈾 ― e₂ dig̃ir-ra-na
The temple of his god

#### 𒂍𒀀𒈾 ― e₂-a-na
into his house

### 𒁉 • (bi, be₂) its
Third-person non-human possessive pronoun.
The /e/ of 𒁉 (bi, be₂) contracts with the vowel of
the genitive case marker /ak/ and the locative case marker /a/.

#### 𒊺𒉻𒁀 ― še šukur₂-ba
the barley of their subsistence allotment

#### 𒂍𒁀 ― e₂-ba
into its house

### 𒈨 • (me /mē/) our
This pronoun does not contract with the locativej /a/ marker.

#### 𒌷𒈨𒀀 ― iri-me-a
in our city

However, it contracts with the genitive /ak/ marker.

#### 𒂕𒁾𒈨𒅗 ― egir dub-me-ka
on the reverse of our tablet

### 𒍪𒉈𒉈 • (zu-ne-ne) your, of you all
Second-person plural possessive pronoun

The final /ē/ of 𒍪𒉈𒉈 (zu-ne-ne) contracts with the
vowel of the genitive case marker /ak/.

#### 𒃻𒂵𒊭𒀭𒍪𒉈𒉈𒅗
nig̃₂ ga-ša-an-zu-ne-ne-ka\

### 𒂊𒉈𒉈 (e-ne-ne) their

### 𒈨 • (me) to be
The word 𒈨 • (me) can also be used as copula.

#### 𒂷𒂊 𒀀𒈾𒈨𒂗 ― g̃e₂₆-e a-na-me-en

#### 𒈠𒈬𒁮 ― ma-mu-dam

### 𒈨𒂗𒉈𒂗 • (me-en-de₃-en)

g̃a₂-e u₃ za-e šeš-me-en-de₃-en\
You and I are brothers.

## The independent pronouns
The independent personal pronouns behave like nouns and can
therefore be followed by case markers such as the genitive
or the ergative.

### 𒂷 or 𒂷𒂊 (g̃e26) - I
### 𒈨𒂊 • (me-e /me/) I

𒂷 (g̃e₂₆ /⁠g̃e⁠/) becomes 𒂷 (g̃a₂ /⁠g̃a⁠/) when followed by a case
marker that contains the vowel /a/, i.e. genitive /ak/,
dative /ra/, or comitative case /da/. Sometimes scribes
added 𒂊 (e) or 𒀀 (a) to make the spelling clear.

#### 𒂷𒀀𒄰 (g̃e₂₆-a-kam)
He is mine.

### 𒍢 • (ze₂ /ze/)  you, thou
Before genitive, dative, and comitative markers,
this pronoun becomes 𒍝 (za).

#### 𒍢𒂊𒈨 𒉺𒁽𒀀𒉌 𒃶𒈨 ― ze₂-e-me maškim-a-ne₂ ḫe₂-me
You should be his commissioner.

### 𒀀𒉈 • (a-ne) he, she 

#### 𒃻 𒉌𒍪𒀀 𒀀𒉈 𒅔𒂵𒀭𒍪
