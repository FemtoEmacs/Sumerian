;; (cn nam ha ba da ku5 e)          𒉆𒄩𒁀𒁕𒋻𒂊\

; which expresses wishes for the third person to fulfill.

There are two kinds of verbal roots in Sumerian. The Akkadians
called them **hamtu** and **marû**. The **marû** is equivalent
of our imperfect. In the relative phrase of the inscription, you
can see an example of the **marû** root. It has the following
components:

1. SHU -- part of the compound verb SHU...UR3 (𒋗...𒃡)
2. BI2 (𒉈) -- Conjugation Prefix (CP)
3. IB2 (𒌈) -- Personal affix cross-referencing the inscription
4. UR3 (𒃡) -- second part of the verb SHU...UR3 (𒋗...𒃡)
5. A (𒀀) -- formative element of adjective from verb

The last verb of the inscription (line 5) has the following components:

1. NAM (𒉆) -- cross-reference to a historic patient
2. HA (𒄩) -- Modal Prefix (MP)
3. BA (𒁀) -- Conjugation Prefix (CP)
4. DA (𒁕) -- Dimensional Prefix (DP) for the comitative
5. KU5 (𒋻) -- verbal element of NAM...KU5 (𒉆...𒋻)
6. E (𒂊) -- **marû** suffix

Note that the verb of the relative clause does not show the **marû** suffix,
because it is omissible, like many other Sumerian markers.

## Translation
For his Lord Gilgamesh of Endimgig, the mighty man Ur-Nammu, the king of Ur, the king of Sumer and Akkad, when he built the temple of Nanna, dedicated this vase for the sake of his life. May Gilgamesh curse the man who erases this inscription.
